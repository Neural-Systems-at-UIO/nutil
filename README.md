# Nutil
Nutil aims to simplify and streamline the mechanism of pre-and-post processing 2D brain imaging data from mouse and rat. It is an integral part of the QUINT workflow for regional quantification of labelled objects such as cells in histological imaging data. 

**For installation and user instructions see:** https://nutil.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 

# Getting started
Download here on github or from https://www.nitrc.org/projects/nutil/

Nutil is written in C++ using standard Qt libraries, and is optimised for parallel operations on multiple CPUs. Nutil does not require any installation, and does not currently utilise any GPU extensions. The external libraries that are used in Nutil are: 
- Libtiff for fast and efficient TIFF file handling (http://www.libtiff.org/)
- LibXLNT for Excel file I/O (https://github.com/tfussell/xlnt/)

# Compiling from source (Windows)
1. In order to compile from scratch, the following software components are also required:
 * On Windows, Microsoft Visual C++ 2019 compiler (MSVC), community version (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)
 * On macOS, XCode (Clang) 
 * On Linux, Gnu C++ compiler
2. Download and install Qt Creator for open source users (https://www.qt.io/download)
 Install the Qt framework version 6 or above (create a user account, custom install, select newest version and MSVC 2019).
3. Install git (https://desktop.github.com/)
4. Clone this repository to a folder (in github desktop: file->clone repository)
5. Open the project file in Qt (file->open file or project)
6. Set up a build path to the project (projects->build->build directory)
7. Compile and run! (ctrl+r)

# Compiling from source on linux (debian-based)
1. git clone https://github.com/Neural-Systems-at-UIO/nutil.git
2. Move to the nutil directory : cd nutil
3. Install the required packages: sudo apt-get install qt5-default qtchooser
4. Run Qmake: qmake
5. Compile: make -j 8 (number of threads)

You can now run Nutil from the command line / bash scripts by simply running
./Nutil myProject.nut 8
or ./Nutil to use the GUI
