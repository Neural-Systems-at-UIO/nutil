<br>To do this, provide a mask that differentiates the two hemispheres, and run quantifier twice - applied to each side in turn - to generate separate reports for each hemisphere.

<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>must be in PNG format</li>
<li>must contain the unique ID for the section and a "_mask" extension.</li>
</ul>
