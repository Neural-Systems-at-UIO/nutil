<h2>Registration file in JSON format</h2>
Navigate to the JSON file from QuickNII or VisuAlign containing the registration information for your sections. Use the same JSON as used to create the atlas maps (for example, if you use atlas maps from VisuAlign, use the JSON file from VisuAlign).

<h3>Requirement</h3>
The image names in the JSON file must include a unique ID. These must correspond to the unique IDs in the files names of the segmentations and atlas maps.

We recommend altering the file names prior to segmentation and atlas-registration to ensure file name consistency.
