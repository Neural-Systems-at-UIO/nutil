**Nutil** have four operations: 

1. **TiffCreator**: convert JPEG, PNG and normal TIFF images to tiled TIFF format.
2. **Transform**: rename, rotate, resize and compile thumbnails of large tiled TIFF images (typical microscopy output format).
3. **Quantifier**: for the batch extraction, quantification and spatial analysis of labelling in mouse or rat brain sections (for example, immunohistochemical labelling).
4. **Resize**: for resizing JPEG/PNG images with output in PNG format.
