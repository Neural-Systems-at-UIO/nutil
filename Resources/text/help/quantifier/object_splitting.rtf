<h2>Counts or Area Fraction (previously called "object splitting")</h2>
<h3>Recommendation</h3>
<p>Select <u>Counts </u> (object splitting = No) for small objects to get accurate object counts (e.g. cells).</p>
<p>Select <u>Area Fraction </u> (object splitting = Yes) for large objects that overlap atlas regions (e.g connectivity data). This gives precise load output but invalidates the object counts. <p>

<h3>Object splitting explained</h3>
<br>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td>
Segmentated objects will in some cases overlap two or more atlas regions. <br>
(for example, the red object shown here overlaps two atlas regions - shown in light and dark green).
<p>
Object splitting divides objects that overlap atlas regions, with individual pixels assigned their precise location.
This gives accurate load measurements (load is the percentage of the region occupied by objects), but invalidates the object counts.</p>
<p>
For accurate object counts, turn this feature <u>OFF</u>. Objects that overlap atlas regions are in this case assigned to one of the regions at random.
This gives accurate counts but less precise load measurements.</p>
