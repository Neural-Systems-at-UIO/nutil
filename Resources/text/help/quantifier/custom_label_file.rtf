<h2>Custom reference atlas</h2>

To use a custom reference brain atlas, it must first be implemented in QuickNII and VisuAlign (make a request through EBRAINS user support). To use your custom atlas, navigate to the .LABEL file corresponding to your reference brain atlas.

NOTE: Customised region definitions must be provided for your custom atlas, enabling Nutil to generate customised region reports. To implement, select <b>Custom</b> for "Customised reports", and navigate to the custom region .XLSX file (see the user documentation for info on customised reports).
