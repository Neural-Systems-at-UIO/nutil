<h2>Unique ID</h2>
Select the format of the unique ID used for your dataset.
<hr>
<h3>Naming requirement</h3>
The file names of the segmentations and atlas maps that correspond to a particular section must contain a unique ID.
The recommended ID format is "_sXXX", with XXX representing the section number. The section number should reflect the serial
order and spacing of the sections (e.g. _s002, _s006, _s010 for every 4th section, starting with section 2). The IDs must match those
in the JSON/XML file and in the mask file names (masks are optional).

<h3>Dropdown menu options</h3>

<h4>1. _sXXX</h4>
_sXXX is the default ID format for both QuickNII and Nutil Quantifier. We recommend changing the files names
as the first step in the QUINT workflow.</p>

<h4>2. user</h4>
<p>For datasets with other ID formats, select "user" and type a Regular Expression (RegExp) that defines your ID in the "other ID format" box. e.g.</p>
<br>
_XXX  : _[0-9]*</li><br>
_XXX. : _[0-9][0-9][0-9].</li><br>
